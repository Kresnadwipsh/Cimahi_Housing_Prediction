## The Project

Hello welcome back! This is my first end-to-end Data Science mini project which incorporates web scraping, data cleaning and analysis, until machine learning modeling. This project is about predicting the selling price of houses in  Cimahi cities and its surroundings, which are located in West Java, Indonesia. The dataset in this project is scraped from __rumah123.com__ , a website for buying and selling property from indonesia. To simplfy data collection, i scraped the data using webscraper app by webcraper.io from google extension.

## The Goals

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning regression model which can predict a house selling price. The other objective is motivated by my dream to buy land, which will build my house later, because I want to have a house located near my parents which is located in Cimahi, amen haha.

## Contents

The __Dataset__ folder contains datasets that are used as long as this project. It including houses the raw dataset straight from the scraping process, datasets that have been cleaned up, until the datasets used for the model.
